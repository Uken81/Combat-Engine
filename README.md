Combat Engine

make a status display for each fighter. Includes stun, if allout etc.

Check all global variables to see if they can be placed in relevant functions instead. 

make an attack head manoeuvre. Harder to hit but does more damage, maybe possible stun????????

Should going under certain threshold of HP incur penalties???????

does hasPlayer1DefenseResolute have to be on both players, can I make it hasPlayerDefenseResolute???

make stun a property of the Characters objects instead of using variables.

<<Future Ideas>>
when combining with fighting fantasy aspect could program narate the battle with many semi-random descriptions of moves.
IE: if attacks succeeds by large margin and defender fails bad "Attacker easily outmanoeuvres Opponent".

Add fatigue?? maybe after certain number of rounds and/or cost FP using manoeuvres??

Add pop-up guides when hovering over certain buttons and stats.

enemy stats will be unknown at first, when they perform certain tasks a possible range can be displayed ie: Attack 7-14. range can be narrowed the more times the relevant skills are used and maybe depending on how close the rolls are.

If initial speed roll is a crit, first attack cant be defended??????, maybe take away option for special manoeuvres attacks.

add in crit fails.

Retreat: on their turn a player can choose to attempt to retreat. They will make a quick contest of speed (retreater rolls at -1???).
on a win the retreater escapes(opponent can make ranged attack if they have ranged weapon).
on a fail they cant defend against the nest attack or defend at disadvantage?????
