Combat Engine

make an attack head maneuver. Harder to hit but does more damage, maybe possible stun????????

Should going under certain threshold of HP incur penalties???????

does hasPlayer1DefenseResolute have to be on both players, can I make it hasPlayerDefenseResolute???

make stun a property of the Characters objects????


<<Future Ideas>>
when combining with fighting fantasy aspect could program narate the battle with many semi-random descriptions of moves.
IE: if attacks succeeds by large margin and defender fails bad "Attacker easily outmaneuvers Opponnent"

enemy stats will be unknown at first, when they perform certain tasks a possible range can be displayed ie: Attack 7-14. range can be narrowed the more times the relevent skills are used and maybe depending on how close the rolls are.

If initial speed roll is a crit, first attck cant be defended??????, maybe take away option for special maneuvers attacks.

add in crit fails.

Retreat: on their turn a player can choose to attempt to retreat. They will make a quick contest of speed (retreater rolls at -1???).
on a win the retreater escapes(opponent can make ranged attack if they have ranged weapon).
on a fail they cant defend against the nest attack or defend at disadvantage?????
